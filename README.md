# Devpost Scraper
Python scraper that collects (winning) submission data from a Devpost hackathon page and writes the data to a CSV file. 

Added:
- Description summarization
- Better formatting
- Multiple URLs support
- Ability to specify number of submissions from each page of a hackathon

TODO:
- Export to document rather than csv
- Creating web application to display submissions

Run with `py .\devpost.py`

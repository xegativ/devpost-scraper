# Devpost Scraper
Python scraper that collects (winning) submission data from a Devpost hackathon page and writes the data to a CSV file. 
Run app with `py .\devpost.py`

Unfortunately, I am lazy, and thus it just uses Flask session to store temporary submission data. Max 4093 bytes for web application.
Run web application with `py .\run.py`
